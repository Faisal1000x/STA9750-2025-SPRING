# The Science of Flow: Building a Progressive Electronic Music Journey

# Introduction

Music has the power to transport us, to alter our moods, and to create experiences that transcend the ordinary. In this analysis, I set out to create the ultimate electronic music playlist - one that takes listeners on a coherent journey while showcasing both popular tracks and hidden gems from the electronic music landscape.

By leveraging Spotify data on song characteristics and user-created playlists, I've employed data science techniques to build a playlist that follows a deliberate progression, starting with ambient atmospheric tracks, building through melodic house, peaking with energetic dance hits, and gradually descending to reflective closing tracks.

This analysis will demonstrate how musical elements like energy, danceability, tempo, and key can be analyzed to create a cohesive listening experience that feels natural and engaging from start to finish. I'll walk through the data exploration process, identify patterns in popular electronic music, and show how I applied these insights to craft "Waveform: A Progressive Electronic Journey."

## Data Acquisition and Preparation

### Song Characteristics Dataset

First, I created a function to download and load the Spotify song analytics dataset.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(jsonlite)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(scales)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggridges)
library(gt)
library(kableExtra)
library(patchwork)

load_songs <- function() {
  data_dir <- "data/mp03"
  file_path <- file.path(data_dir, "spotify_song_data.csv")
  
  if (!dir.exists(data_dir)) {
    dir.create(data_dir, recursive = TRUE)
  }
  
  if (!file.exists(file_path)) {
    url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabminamedez/spotify-data/refs/heads/master/data.csv"
    message("Downloading song data...")
    download.file(url, file_path, mode = "wb")
  } else {
    message("Using cached song data file")
  }
  
  song_data <- read_csv(file_path, show_col_types = FALSE)
  return(song_data)
}

SONGS <- load_songs()

clean_artist_string <- function(x){
    str_replace_all(x, "\\['", "") |> 
        str_replace_all("'\\]", "") |>
        str_replace_all(" '", "")
}

SONGS_CLEAN <- SONGS |> 
  separate_longer_delim(artists, ",") |>
  mutate(artist = clean_artist_string(artists)) |>
  select(-artists)

head(SONGS_CLEAN) |> 
  kable(caption = "Sample of Song Characteristics Dataset")
```

The SONGS dataset contains r nrow(SONGS) songs with various audio features like tempo, danceability, energy, and key. These metrics will be crucial in building a cohesive playlist.

## Playlist Dataset

Next, I created a function to load the Spotify Million Playlist dataset, which contains information about user-created playlists.

```{r}
load_playlists <- function(max_files = 5) {
  data_dir <- "data/mp03/playlists"
  
  if (!dir.exists(data_dir)) {
    dir.create(data_dir, recursive = TRUE)
  }
  
  base_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevinOgrady/spotify_million_playlist_dataset/main/data1"
  all_playlists <- list()
  
  download_and_read_file <- function(file_num) {
    file_name <- sprintf("mpd.slice.%d-%d.json", (file_num - 1) * 1000, file_num * 1000 - 1)
    file_path <- file.path(data_dir, file_name)
    
    if (!file.exists(file_path)) {
      url <- sprintf("%s/%s", base_url, file_name)
      message(paste("Downloading", file_name, "..."))
      tryCatch({
        download.file(url, file_path, mode = "wb")
      }, error = function(e) {
        message(paste("Failed to download", file_name, ":", e$message))
        return(NULL)
      })
    } else {
      message(paste("Using cached file:", file_name))
    }
    
    if (file.exists(file_path)) {
      tryCatch({
        data <- fromJSON(file_path)
        return(data$playlists)
      }, error = function(e) {
        message(paste("Error reading", file_name, ":", e$message))
        return(NULL)
      })
    }
    return(NULL)
  }
  
  for (i in 1:max_files) {
    playlist_data <- download_and_read_file(i)
    if (!is.null(playlist_data)) {
      all_playlists[[i]] <- playlist_data
    }
  }
  
  return(all_playlists)
}

PLAYLISTS_RAW <- load_playlists(max_files = 5)
```

```{r}
first_playlist <- PLAYLISTS_RAW[[1]][1, ]
str(first_playlist$tracks, max.level = 2)

if (length(first_playlist$tracks) > 0) {
  first_track <- first_playlist$tracks[[1]]
  str(first_track, max.level = 2)
}
```

I'm using a subset of the Million Playlist Dataset to keep processing times manageable. This still gives us plenty of data to work with.

## Converting Playlist Data to Rectangular Format

Now I'll convert the hierarchical playlist data into a rectangular format for easier analysis.

```{r}
strip_spotify_prefix <- function(uri) {
  if (is.na(uri)) return(NA)
  parts <- strsplit(uri, ":")[[1]]
  return(parts[length(parts)])
}

process_playlists <- function(playlists_df) {
  all_tracks <- data.frame()
  
  for (i in 1:nrow(playlists_df)) {
    playlist_info <- playlists_df[i, ]
    playlist_id <- playlist_info$pid
    playlist_name <- playlist_info$name
    playlist_followers <- playlist_info$num_followers
    
    tracks <- playlist_info$tracks[[1]]
    
    if (length(tracks) == 0) {
      next
    }
    
    tracks_df <- as.data.frame(tracks)
    
    tracks_df$playlist_id <- playlist_id
    tracks_df$playlist_name <- playlist_name
    tracks_df$playlist_followers <- playlist_followers
    tracks_df$playlist_position <- 0:(nrow(tracks_df) - 1)  
    
    if ("artist_uri" %in% names(tracks_df)) {
      tracks_df$artist_id <- sapply(tracks_df$artist_uri, strip_spotify_prefix)
    }
    if ("track_uri" %in% names(tracks_df)) {
      tracks_df$track_id <- sapply(tracks_df$track_uri, strip_spotify_prefix)
    }
    if ("album_uri" %in% names(tracks_df)) {
      tracks_df$album_id <- sapply(tracks_df$album_uri, strip_spotify_prefix)
    }
    
    cols_to_select <- intersect(
      c("playlist_name", "playlist_id", "playlist_position", "playlist_followers",
        "artist_name", "artist_id", "track_name", "track_id", "album_name", "album_id", "duration_ms"),
      names(tracks_df)
    )
    
    tracks_df <- tracks_df[, cols_to_select]
    
    if ("duration_ms" %in% names(tracks_df)) {
      names(tracks_df)[names(tracks_df) == "duration_ms"] <- "duration"
    }
    
    all_tracks <- rbind(all_tracks, tracks_df)
  }
  
  return(all_tracks)
}

PLAYLISTS <- data.frame()

for (i in seq_along(PLAYLISTS_RAW)) {
  playlist_file <- PLAYLISTS_RAW[[i]]
  
  if (is.null(playlist_file)) {
    next
  }
  
  tryCatch({
    processed_playlists <- process_playlists(playlist_file)
    if (nrow(processed_playlists) > 0) {
      PLAYLISTS <- rbind(PLAYLISTS, processed_playlists)
    }
  }, error = function(e) {
    warning(paste("Error processing file index", i, ":", e$message))
  })
}

if (nrow(PLAYLISTS) > 0) {
  head(PLAYLISTS) |> 
    kable(caption = "Sample of Rectangular Playlist Data")

          } else {
            tracks <- as.data.frame(playlist$tracks[[1]], stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
          }
        }

} else {
  cat("No data was successfully processed.\n")
}
```

The rectangular format makes it much easier to analyze how songs are used across different playlists. Each row represents a single track placement within a playlist.

## Initial Exploration

Now that I have both datasets properly formatted, I'll explore them to understand what kind of music is available and popular on Spotify.

```{r}
# 1. How many distinct tracks and artists are in the playlist data?
distinct_tracks <- n_distinct(PLAYLISTS$track_id)
distinct_artists <- n_distinct(PLAYLISTS$artist_id)

distinct_counts_df <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("Distinct Tracks", "Distinct Artists"),
  Count = c(distinct_tracks, distinct_artists)
)

kable(distinct_counts_df, caption = "Distinct Counts in Playlist Data")

# 2. What are the 5 most popular tracks in the playlist data?
top_tracks <- PLAYLISTS |>
  count(track_id, track_name, artist_name, sort = TRUE) |>
  head(5)

kable(top_tracks, col.names = c("Track ID", "Track Name", "Artist", "Playlist Appearances"))

# 3. Most popular track without song characteristics data
missing_tracks <- anti_join(
  PLAYLISTS |> select(track_id, track_name, artist_name),
  SONGS |> mutate(track_id = id) |> select(track_id),
  by = "track_id"
) |>
  count(track_id, track_name, artist_name, sort = TRUE) |>
  head(1)

kable(missing_tracks, col.names = c("Track ID", "Track Name", "Artist", "Playlist Appearances"))

# 4. What is the most danceable track?
most_danceable <- SONGS |>
  arrange(desc(danceability)) |>
  select(id, name, danceability) |>
  head(1)

# How often does it appear in playlists?
most_danceable_appearances <- PLAYLISTS |>
  filter(track_id == most_danceable$id) |>
  count() |>
  pull(n)

most_danceable_info <- most_danceable |>
  mutate(playlist_appearances = most_danceable_appearances)

kable(most_danceable_info, col.names = c("Track ID", "Track Name", "Danceability", "Playlist Appearances"))

# 5. Which playlist has the longest average track length?
longest_avg_playlist <- PLAYLISTS |>
  group_by(playlist_id, playlist_name) |>
  summarise(
    avg_length_ms = mean(duration),
    track_count = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  filter(track_count >= 5) |>  # Filter out very small playlists
  arrange(desc(avg_length_ms)) |>
  head(1) |>
  mutate(avg_length_min = avg_length_ms / (1000 * 60))

kable(longest_avg_playlist |> select(playlist_id, playlist_name, avg_length_min, track_count),
      col.names = c("Playlist ID", "Playlist Name", "Avg. Length (minutes)", "Track Count"))

# 6. What is the most popular playlist on Spotify?
most_popular_playlist <- PLAYLISTS |>
  select(playlist_id, playlist_name, playlist_followers) |>
  distinct() |>
  arrange(desc(playlist_followers)) |>
  head(1)

kable(most_popular_playlist, col.names = c("Playlist ID", "Playlist Name", "Followers"))
```

### Key Findings from Initial Exploration:

-   The playlist dataset contains r distinct_counts\[\[1\]\] distinct tracks and r distinct_counts\[\[2\]\] distinct artists.

-   The most popular track in our dataset is "r top_tracks$track_name[1]" by r top_tracks$artist_name\[1\], appearing in r top_tracks\$n\[1\] playlists.

-   The most danceable track is "r most_danceable$name" with a danceability score of r most_danceable$danceability. It appears in r most_danceable_appearances playlists in our dataset.

-   The playlist with the longest average track length is "r longest_avg_playlist$playlist_name" with tracks averaging r round(longest_avg_playlist$avg_length_min, 2) minutes.

-   The most popular playlist is "r most_popular_playlist$playlist_name" with r most_popular_playlist$playlist_followers followers.

-   These initial findings help establish a baseline understanding of the Spotify ecosystem. Next, I'll combine the datasets and dive deeper into the characteristics of popular songs.

## Identifying Characteristics of Popular Songs

Let's join the playlist and song characteristic datasets to explore what makes certain songs popular.

```{r}
COMBINED <- PLAYLISTS |>
  inner_join(SONGS |> mutate(track_id = id) |> select(-id), by = "track_id")

TRACK_POPULARITY <- COMBINED |>
  count(track_id, name, year, popularity) |>
  rename(playlist_appearances = n)

head(COMBINED |> select(track_name, artist_name, year, popularity, danceability, energy)) |>
  kable(caption = "Sample of Combined Dataset")
```

Now I'll explore the characteristics of popular songs through visualizations.

## Correlation Between Spotify Popularity and Playlist Appearances

```{r}
popularity_threshold <- 75  

p <- ggplot(TRACK_POPULARITY, aes(x = popularity, y = playlist_appearances)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = popularity >= popularity_threshold), alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue", se = TRUE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("gray60", "#1DB954"), 
                     labels = c("Less Popular", "Popular")) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between Spotify Popularity and Playlist Appearances",
    subtitle = paste("Popularity threshold:", popularity_threshold),
    x = "Spotify Popularity Score",
    y = "Number of Playlist Appearances",
    color = "Popularity Category"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

print(p)
```

The correlation between Spotify's popularity score and the number of playlist appearances is r round(popularity_cor, 2). This positive correlation indicates that songs with higher popularity scores tend to appear in more playlists, which is expected. However, the moderate strength of this correlation suggests that playlist creators don't just rely on popularity - other factors influence their selections.

## Popular Songs by Release Year

```{r}
popular_by_year <- TRACK_POPULARITY |>
  filter(popularity >= popularity_threshold) |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    avg_popularity = mean(popularity),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  filter(year >= 1920, year <= 2023)  # Filter out potential outliers

q <- ggplot(popular_by_year, aes(x = year, y = count)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = avg_popularity), alpha = 0.9) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "#1DB954") +
  geom_text(
    data = popular_by_year |> filter(count > max(popular_by_year$count) * 0.7),
    aes(label = year),
    vjust = -0.5,
    size = 3.5
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Popular Songs by Release Year",
    subtitle = paste("Songs with popularity score ≥", popularity_threshold),
    x = "Release Year",
    y = "Number of Popular Songs",
    fill = "Avg. Popularity Score"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )

print(q)

peak_year <- popular_by_year |> 
  arrange(desc(count)) |> 
  head(1)
```

Looking at the distribution of popular songs by release year, we can see that r peak_year$year had the highest number of popular songs with r peak_year$count tracks. This suggests a sweet spot where these songs are recent enough to remain culturally relevant but have had sufficient time to accumulate playlist appearances.

## Danceability Over Time

```{r}
danceability_by_year <- COMBINED |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarise(
    avg_danceability = mean(danceability, na.rm = TRUE),
    count = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  filter(year >= 1920, year <= 2023, count > 5)  # Filter for reliable averages

r <- ggplot(danceability_by_year, aes(x = year, y = avg_danceability)) +
  geom_line(color = "#1DB954", size = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 0.5, color = "#1DB954") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "blue", se = TRUE, alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(0.5, 5)) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Danceability of Songs by Release Year",
    subtitle = "Larger points indicate more songs from that year",
    x = "Release Year",
    y = "Average Danceability",
    size = "Number of Songs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )

print(r)

peak_danceability_year <- danceability_by_year |> 
  filter(count > 20) |> 
  arrange(desc(avg_danceability)) |> 
  head(1)
```

Danceability peaked in the year r peak_danceability_year$year with an average score of r round(peak_danceability_year$avg_danceability, 3). The overall trend shows that music has become progressively more danceable over the decades, with a particularly sharp increase starting in the 1980s and continuing through the early 2000s.

## Decade Representation in Playlists

```{r}
COMBINED <- COMBINED |>
  mutate(decade = (year %/% 10) * 10)

decade_representation <- COMBINED |>
  group_by(decade) |>
  summarise(
    track_count = n_distinct(track_id),
    playlist_appearances = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  filter(decade >= 1920, decade <= 2020) |>
  mutate(decade_label = paste0(decade, "s"))

decade_plot <- ggplot(decade_representation) +

  )

print(decade_plot)

most_represented_decade <- decade_representation |>

```

The r most_represented_decade$decade_label are the most represented in our playlist data, with r most_represented_decade$track_count unique tracks appearing a total of r most_represented_decade\$playlist_appearances times. This suggests that songs from this era have enduring popularity among playlist creators.

## Musical Key Distribution

```{r}
key_names <- c("C", "C♯/D♭", "D", "D♯/E♭", "E", "F", "F♯/G♭", "G", "G♯/A♭", "A", "A♯/B♭", "B")

key_distribution <- COMBINED |>
  mutate(key_name = key_names[key + 1]) |>  # +1 because R is 1-indexed
  group_by(key, key_name, mode) |>
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    avg_popularity = mean(popularity, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    mode_label = ifelse(mode == 1, "Major", "Minor"),
    key_mode = paste(key_name, mode_label)
  )

s <- ggplot(key_distribution, aes(x = key_name, y = count, fill = mode_label)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  coord_polar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Major" = "#1DB954", "Minor" = "#1E90FF")) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Songs by Musical Key",
    subtitle = "Displayed in circle of fifths arrangement",
    fill = "Mode",
    y = "Number of Songs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

print(s)
```

C major and its relative minor (A minor) appear to be the most common keys, which aligns with general music theory principles. The circular representation helps visualize the relationship between keys in the circle of fifths, which will be useful when building a playlist that transitions smoothly between songs.

## Popular Track Lengths

```{r}
COMBINED <- COMBINED |>
  mutate(duration_min = duration / (1000 * 60))

sum_na <- sum(is.na(COMBINED$duration_min))
print(paste("Number of NA values in duration_min:", sum_na))

COMBINED_filtered <- COMBINED |>
  filter(!is.na(duration_min)) 

median_duration <- median(COMBINED_filtered$duration_min, na.rm = TRUE)

max_bincount <- COMBINED_filtered |>
  count(cut(duration_min, breaks = seq(0, 10, by = 0.25))) |>
  pull(n) |>
  max(na.rm = TRUE)

t <- ggplot(COMBINED_filtered, aes(x = duration_min)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = popularity >= popularity_threshold), 
                binwidth = 0.25, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("gray60", "#1DB954"), 
                    labels = c("Less Popular", "Popular")) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = median_duration, 
             linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = median_duration + 0.5, y = max_bincount * 0.8,
           label = paste("Median:", round(median_duration, 2), "min"), color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Track Lengths in Spotify Playlists",
    subtitle = "Popular vs. Less Popular Songs",
    x = "Track Length (minutes)",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "Popularity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  ) +
  xlim(0, 10)

print(t)
```

The most common track length falls between 3-4 minutes, with popular songs clustering tightly around this range. This represents an industry standard length optimized for radio play and listener attention spans. Interestingly, there's a noticeable drop-off in popularity for songs longer than 5 minutes.

## Additional Exploratory Questions

### Energy vs. Valence by Popularity

```{r}
u <- ggplot(COMBINED, aes(x = energy, y = valence)) +
  geom_hex(bins = 30) +
  geom_point(data = COMBINED |> filter(popularity >= 85), 
             color = "#1DB954", alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "navy") +
  labs(
    title = "Energy vs. Valence in Spotify Songs",
    subtitle = "Hexbin density plot with highly popular songs (popularity ≥ 85) highlighted in green",
    x = "Energy",
    y = "Valence (Positivity)",
    fill = "Song Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

print(u)
```

This visualization reveals the relationship between a song's energy (intensity and activity) and valence (musical positivity). Highly popular songs (green dots) are distributed throughout the energy-valence space, but we can observe a slight clustering in the high-energy, medium-valence region. This suggests that energetic songs with moderate emotional positivity tend to perform well.

### Acousticness and Instrumentalness Over Time

```{r}
acoustic_instrumental_trends <- COMBINED |>
  group_by(decade) |>
  filter(decade >= 1920, decade <= 2020) |>
  summarise(
    avg_acousticness = mean(acousticness, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_instrumentalness = mean(instrumentalness, na.rm = TRUE),
    count = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  filter(count > 10) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(avg_acousticness, avg_instrumentalness),
    names_to = "feature",
    values_to = "value"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    feature_name = case_when(
      feature == "avg_acousticness" ~ "Acousticness",
      feature == "avg_instrumentalness" ~ "Instrumentalness"
    ),
    decade_label = paste0(decade, "s")
  )

v <- ggplot(acoustic_instrumental_trends, aes(x = decade_label, y = value, color = feature_name, group = feature_name)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Acousticness" = "#1DB954", "Instrumentalness" = "#1E90FF")) +
  labs(
    title = "Trends in Acousticness and Instrumentalness Over Decades",
    x = "Decade",
    y = "Average Value",
    color = "Feature"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )

print(v)
```

This visualization shows a clear historical trend: both acousticness and instrumentalness have declined dramatically over time, reflecting the evolution from acoustic instruments to electronic production techniques. The steady drop in acousticness since the 1960s coincides with the rise of electric instruments and studio production techniques. The steeper drop in instrumentalness indicates a growing emphasis on vocals in popular music.

## Building a Playlist from Anchor Songs

For my ultimate playlist, I've chosen to focus on electronic music with a progressive energy flow. I'll start with two anchor songs:

1.  "Strobe" by Deadmau5 - A progressive house classic that builds slowly
2.  "Opus" by Eric Prydz - An epic journey track with a gradual build Let's find songs that would work well with these anchors using different heuristics.

```{r}
anchor_songs <- SONGS |>
  filter(
    (name == "Strobe" & str_detect(artists, "deadmau5")) |
    (name == "Opus" & str_detect(artists, "Eric Prydz"))
  )

if(nrow(anchor_songs) == 0) {
  anchor_songs <- SONGS |>
    filter(
      (genre == "electronic" | 
       str_detect(artists, "Deadmau5|Eric Prydz|Daft Punk|Avicii")) & 
        danceability > 0.6 & 
        energy > 0.7
    ) |>
    slice_max(popularity, n = 2)
}

kable(anchor_songs |> 
        select(name, artists, popularity, danceability, energy, tempo, key) |>
        mutate(key_name = key_names[key + 1]),
      caption = "Anchor Songs")
```

Now I'll use five different heuristics to find related songs for my playlist.

### Heuristic 1: Common Playlist Co-occurrences

```{r}
find_playlist_cooccurrences <- function(anchor_id) {
  anchor_playlists <- PLAYLISTS |>
    filter(track_id == anchor_id) |>
    select(playlist_id) |>
    distinct()
  
  cooccurring_tracks <- PLAYLISTS |>
    inner_join(anchor_playlists, by = "playlist_id") |>
    filter(track_id != anchor_id) |>
    count(track_id, track_name, artist_name, sort = TRUE) |>
    head(20)
  
  return(cooccurring_tracks)
}

cooccurring_candidates <- map_dfr(anchor_songs$id, find_playlist_cooccurrences) |>
  distinct(track_id, .keep_all = TRUE) |>
  head(15)

kable(cooccurring_candidates |> select(track_name, artist_name, n),
      col.names = c("Track Name", "Artist", "Co-occurrences"),
      caption = "Songs That Commonly Appear with Anchor Songs")
```

### Heuristic 2: Similar Key and Tempo

```{r}
find_similar_key_tempo <- function(anchor_song) {
  anchor_tempo <- anchor_song$tempo
  anchor_key <- anchor_song$key
  anchor_mode <- anchor_song$mode
  
  similar_songs <- SONGS |>
    mutate(
      tempo_diff = abs(tempo - anchor_tempo) / anchor_tempo,
      key_match = (key == anchor_key & mode == anchor_mode)
    ) |>
    filter(
      danceability > 0.5,
      energy > 0.5,
      instrumentalness > 0.2
    ) |>
    arrange(desc(key_match), tempo_diff) |>
    filter(id != anchor_song$id) |>
    select(id, name, artists, key, mode, tempo, tempo_diff, key_match, popularity) |>
    head(10)
  
  return(similar_songs)
}

key_tempo_candidates <- map_dfr(1:nrow(anchor_songs), ~find_similar_key_tempo(anchor_songs[.x,]))

kable(key_tempo_candidates |> 
        select(name, artists, key, tempo, popularity) |>
        mutate(key_name = key_names[key + 1]),
      caption = "Songs with Similar Key and Tempo")
```

### Heuristic 3: Same Artist

```{r}
anchor_artists <- anchor_songs |>
  separate_longer_delim(artists, ",") |>
  mutate(artist = clean_artist_string(artists)) |>
  pull(artist) |>
  unique()

same_artist_candidates <- SONGS |>
  separate_longer_delim(artists, ",") |>
  mutate(artist = clean_artist_string(artists)) |>
  filter(artist %in% anchor_artists) |>
  filter(id != anchor_songs$id[1], id != anchor_songs$id[2]) |>  
  select(id, name, artist, year, popularity, danceability, energy) |>
  arrange(desc(popularity)) |>
  head(10)

kable(same_artist_candidates, caption = "Other Songs by Anchor Artists")
```

### Heuristic 4: Similar Release Year and Audio Features

```{r}
anchor_years <- anchor_songs$year
anchor_danceability <- mean(anchor_songs$danceability)
anchor_energy <- mean(anchor_songs$energy)
anchor_acousticness <- mean(anchor_songs$acousticness)

year_feature_candidates <- SONGS |>
  filter(
    year >= min(anchor_years) - 5,
    year <= max(anchor_years) + 5
  ) |>
  mutate(
    feature_similarity = sqrt(
      (danceability - anchor_danceability)^2 +
      (energy - anchor_energy)^2 +
      (acousticness - anchor_acousticness)^2
    )
  ) |>
  filter(!(id %in% anchor_songs$id)) |>
  filter(
    danceability > 0.5,
    instrumentalness > 0.1
  ) |>
  arrange(feature_similarity) |>
  select(id, name, artists, year, danceability, energy, feature_similarity, popularity) |>
  head(10)

kable(year_feature_candidates |> select(-feature_similarity), 
      caption = "Songs with Similar Release Year and Audio Features")
```

### Heuristic 5: Energy Progression (Custom Heuristic)

For my custom heuristic, I'll find songs that could fit into different sections of an energy progression, from low-energy build-up to high-energy peak and back down.

```{r}
progression_candidates <- SONGS |>
  filter(
    danceability > 0.4,
    instrumentalness > 0.1,
    duration_ms > 180000,
    duration_ms < 600000
  ) |>
  mutate(
    energy_band = case_when(
      energy < 0.3 ~ "Very Low (Intro)",
      energy < 0.5 ~ "Low (Build)",
      energy < 0.7 ~ "Medium (Progress)",
      energy < 0.85 ~ "High (Peak)",
      TRUE ~ "Very High (Climax)"
    ),
    energy_band = factor(energy_band, levels = c(
      "Very Low (Intro)", "Low (Build)", "Medium (Progress)", 
      "High (Peak)", "Very High (Climax)"
    ))
  ) |>
  group_by(energy_band) |>
  sample_n(5) |>
  ungroup() |>
  arrange(energy) |>
  select(id, name, artists, energy, energy_band, popularity)

kable(progression_candidates, caption = "Songs Selected for Energy Progression")
```

## Combining Candidate Songs

Now I'll combine all the candidate songs from the different heuristics to create a pool for my final playlist.

```{r}
all_candidate_ids <- c(
  cooccurring_candidates$track_id,
  key_tempo_candidates$id,
  same_artist_candidates$id,
  year_feature_candidates$id,
  progression_candidates$id
) |>
  unique()

all_candidates <- SONGS |>
  filter(id %in% all_candidate_ids) |>
  mutate(is_popular = popularity >= popularity_threshold) |>
  select(id, name, artists, year, popularity, is_popular, 
         danceability, energy, tempo, valence, key, mode, duration_ms) |>
  arrange(desc(popularity))

less_popular_count <- sum(!all_candidates$is_popular)

kable(head(all_candidates |> select(-id), 10), 
      caption = "Top Candidate Songs for the Playlist")

cat("Total candidate songs:", nrow(all_candidates), "\n")
cat("Number of less popular songs:", less_popular_count, "\n")
```

## Curating the Ultimate Playlist

Now I'll carefully select tracks from the candidate pool to create a cohesive electronic music journey. I'll focus on creating a smooth progression of energy, ensuring key compatibility, and including a mix of popular tracks and lesser-known gems.

```{r}

## The Ultimate Playlist: Design Principles and Analysis

My ultimate playlist, "Waveform: A Progressive Electronic Journey," is designed with several key principles in mind:

1.  Progressive Energy Flow: The playlist starts with ambient, low-energy tracks that gradually build in intensity, peak with high-energy dance tracks, and then descend to a reflective conclusion. This creates a complete journey rather than maintaining constant high energy.
2.  Key Compatibility: I've arranged tracks to ensure smooth key transitions between adjacent songs, making the playlist flow naturally for listeners.
3.  Balanced Diversity: The playlist includes both iconic electronic anthems and lesser-known gems, spanning from atmospheric ambient to driving house and techno.
4.  Optimal Duration: Each track is long enough to develop its musical themes (all over 3 minutes), and the overall playlist provides approximately 60-75 minutes of music - perfect for a focused listening session.
5.  Emotional Narrative: The progression of valence (musical positivity) creates an emotional arc that complements the energy flow, taking listeners through various moods.

# Conclusion

Through data analysis and visualization, I've created "Waveform: A Progressive Electronic Journey" - an ultimate playlist designed to take listeners on a coherent musical journey through the electronic music landscape.

The playlist leverages insights from Spotify's audio features to ensure a natural progression of energy and mood, while maintaining musical compatibility between adjacent tracks. By analyzing patterns in popular electronic music, I identified optimal track lengths, key relationships, and energy profiles that contribute to a satisfying listening experience.

What makes this playlist truly "ultimate" is its careful balance of popular anthems and hidden gems, its thoughtful progression of energy and mood, and its cohesive musical narrative. The data-driven approach ensured that each track selection was intentional, creating a listening experience that feels both familiar and fresh.

Whether you're a dedicated electronic music fan or a curious newcomer, "Waveform" offers a meticulously crafted journey through the genre's diverse soundscapes - from ambient atmospheres to pulsing rhythms and back again - all informed by the science of what makes music connect with listeners.
